### 📋 Day 1 Checklist
- [ ] Fix package.json main entry (validate current state)
- [ ] Complete Deno removal and establish Node.js-only runtime
- [ ] Create organized directory structure
- [ ] Install Progressive Precommit Phase 1 (gentle suggestions)
- [ ] Establish performance baselines (CLI startup, build time, memory)
- [ ] Create rollback point with git tag
- [ ] Validate core functionality operational
- [ ] Document file categorization system for Day 2

## 🔧 CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS

### Package.json State Analysis
**BEFORE**: Analyzing current configuration...
**Current main entry**: `"main": "dist/cli/simple-cli.js"` ✅
**Status**: Main entry appears correctly configured

### Runtime Scripts Analysis
**Current scripts under analysis by Foundation-Stabilizer agent**
- Build scripts: Multiple build targets identified
- Development scripts: Mixed tsx/node execution
- MCP scripts: Multiple server entry points
- Test scripts: Jest configuration present

---

## 🗂️ DIRECTORY STRUCTURE CREATION

### Target Structure
Creating organized directory hierarchy:
```
docs/
├── analysis/          # Technical analysis documents
├── implementation/    # Implementation guides and plans
├── architecture/      # Architecture specifications
├── reports/          # Status and progress reports
├── completed/        # Completed implementation files
├── testing/          # Test-related documentation
├── performance/      # Performance analysis and benchmarks
├── migration/        # Migration guides and procedures
└── integration/      # Integration documentation

analysis-archive/
├── 2024/            # Archived 2024 analysis files
└── 2025/            # Archived 2025 analysis files
```

**Status**: Directory creation in progress by Structure-Organizer agent

---

## 🚫 DENO ELIMINATION STATUS

### Deno References Search
**Analysis in progress by Dependency-Analyzer agent**
- Searching for "Deno." references
- Identifying remaining deno run commands
- Checking for deno:// protocol imports
- Validating Node.js alternatives in place

### Node.js Runtime Transition
- Target: 100% Node.js runtime
- Remove: All Deno dependencies
- Preserve: All functionality through Node.js equivalents

---

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE BASELINES

### Baseline Measurements
**Performance-Validator agent establishing baselines**

#### CLI Startup Time
- Command: `./bin/claude-flow --help`
- Iterations: 10 runs for statistical accuracy
- Target: <2 seconds average startup

#### Build Performance
- Command: `npm run clean && npm run build`
- Measuring: Total compilation time
- Target: <2 minutes for full build

#### Memory Usage
- Measuring: Peak memory during CLI operations
- Tools: System monitoring during execution
- Target: <256MB peak usage

---

## 🔄 PROGRESSIVE PRECOMMIT SETUP

### Phase 1 Configuration (Gentle Suggestions)
**Quality-Assurance agent installing precommit system**

#### Active Hooks (Non-blocking):
- Basic file quality checks
- TypeScript compilation (errors only)
- Biome linting (warnings allowed)
- Security scanning (detect-secrets)
- File organization suggestions
- Directory structure validation

#### Dependencies Installation:
- `detect-secrets` - Security scanning
- `glob` - File pattern matching
- Pre-commit hooks infrastructure

---

## 🛡️ ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Git Rollback Point
**System-Coordinator agent creating safety net**

- **Tag**: `rollback-phase1-start`
- **Purpose**: Complete rollback to pre-foundation state
- **Backup Location**: `backup/phase1/`
- **Files Backed Up**:
  - `src/cli/` directory
  - `package.json`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - Critical configuration files
