Lint the code and Fix manually (no script) all the build errors outputed from npm run buid commands (there are a lot). Think before fixing them to not create new errors. Only focus on errors and not warning. Understand the error before fixing, analyse relation to the code and arch. Spawn agents to independ type of errors. Also change cliffy package of work-command which is made for deno (which we dont use), think about the best alternative, no simplificaiton, think and analyse its usage. Also improve the exit process for the hive command which does not work, well, inspire yourself with work command.",
