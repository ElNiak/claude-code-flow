Only focus on errors and not warning. Understand the error before fixing, analyse relation to the code and arch. Continue fixing all error, but consider i you sub agents tasks to indicate to also remove all reference to UI/GUI feature, this complexify the code and is notusefull when fixing the errors. Also check for .archive/backup/phase1/ cli version when fixing errors, since we recently have a folder reorganisation, we might have introduce bugs (hive-mind is now wrong compare to archived version).Spawn agents to independ type of errors",
