## üö® **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS**

After comprehensive code analysis, these are **NOT variations of the same system** but three **completely different architectural approaches** to AI coordination:

1. **SPARC** = Methodology-driven external process orchestration
2. **HIVE** = Collective intelligence with democratic consensus  
3. **SWARM** = Distributed autonomous coordination system

---

## üéØ **SPARC: Methodology-Driven External Orchestration**

### **What SPARC Actually Is**
**NOT an internal agent system** - SPARC is a **sophisticated prompt enhancement and external process orchestrator** that:

- **Spawns External Claude CLI Processes** using `Deno.Command` or `child_process.spawn`
- **Enhances Prompts with Workflow Templates** for 17+ specialized methodologies
- **Orchestrates Sequential Workflows** with time estimates and phase gates
- **Provides Methodology Enforcement** through structured templates

### **Core Architecture**
```typescript
// Actual execution pattern from code
SPARC Command ‚Üí Configuration Loading (.roomodes) ‚Üí 
Prompt Enhancement ‚Üí External Claude CLI Spawn ‚Üí 
Memory Persistence ‚Üí Result Collection
```

### **17+ SPARC Modes (Actual Implementation)**
Based on code analysis of `src/cli/commands/sparc-modes/`:

- **ask.js** - Interactive Q&A with guided exploration
- **debug.js** - Systematic debugging with error analysis workflows
- **devops.js** - Infrastructure and deployment methodologies
- **docs-writer.js** - Documentation generation with structured templates
- **integration.js** - System integration with compatibility analysis
- **mcp.js** - MCP tool development with protocol compliance
- **monitoring.js** - System monitoring with metrics and alerting
- **optimization.js** - Performance optimization with profiling workflows
- **orchestrator.js** - Workflow orchestration and coordination
- **security-review.js** - Security analysis with threat modeling
- **spec-pseudocode.js** - Specification and design documentation
- **supabase-admin.js** - Supabase database administration
- **tdd.js** - Test-driven development with red-green-refactor cycles
- **tutorial.js** - Interactive tutorials and learning workflows
- **generic.js** - General-purpose assistance with flexible templates

### **Key Implementation Characteristics**
- **Sequential Execution**: One phase at a time with user confirmation
- **External Process Dependency**: Requires `claude` CLI to be available
- **Template-Based**: Uses workflow templates with time estimates
- **Memory Namespace Handoffs**: Each phase stores artifacts for the next
- **Safety Constraints**: File size limits, directory safety, no secrets

### **When SPARC is Used**
- Methodology compliance is required (TDD, security review, etc.)
- Sequential phase-gate processes are needed
- Educational or training environments
- Quality assurance through structured workflows
- External Claude CLI integration is acceptable

## üß† **HIVE: Collective Intelligence with Democratic Consensus**

### **What HIVE Actually Is**
A **genuine collective intelligence system** implementing Queen-Worker architecture with:
