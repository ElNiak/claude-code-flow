## 1. State Snapshot

### Current Infrastructure Analysis

**PROJECT PROFILE DETECTED**:

- **Type**: Tooling/Infrastructure (CLI-based agent orchestration system)

- ✅ Performance Metrics System (`.claude-flow/metrics/`) - Basic tracking
- ⚠️ Console Logging: 3,941 occurrences across 476 files - Needs consolidation
- ❌ No centralized debug strategy or component-specific controls

**CODEBASE HEALTH ASSESSMENT**:

- **Strengths**: Well-structured interfaces, comprehensive test suite, modular design
- **Technical Debt**: 15+ legacy files identified, 4 major duplication patterns
- **Architectural Debt**: Mixed module systems, inconsistent error handling
- **Refactor Readiness**: 60% - Good foundation but needs systematic cleanup

**RECENT ACTIVITY CONTEXT** (from git log analysis):

- Version bump to v2.0.0-alpha.79 with repository cleanup initiatives

## 5. Test Strategy

### Testing Approach (Adapted for Infrastructure Project)

#### Unit Testing Strategy

**Target Coverage**: >95% for new debug logging infrastructure
**Focus Areas**:

- Logger interface implementations and method contracts
- Configuration parsing and validation logic
- Security redaction and PII detection
- Performance timing and resource tracking
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Test Categories**:

```gherkin
Feature: Component Debug Logging
  Scenario: Component-specific log level filtering
    Given CLI debug level is "info" and MCP debug level is "debug"
    When both components generate debug messages
    Then only MCP debug messages should appear

Feature: Performance Requirements
  Scenario: Minimal overhead when disabled
    Given debug logging is disabled globally
    When system processes 1000 operations
    Then overhead should be <5% of baseline execution time
```

#### Integration Testing Strategy

**Scope**: Cross-component debug logging workflows
**Key Scenarios**:

- End-to-end correlation tracking across agent spawning
- MCP tool invocation logging with claude-code integration
- Configuration hot-reload during active debugging sessions
- Fault tolerance during log destination failures

#### Performance Testing Strategy

**Benchmarks**:

- High-throughput logging: 10,000+ entries/second
- Concurrent agent logging: 100+ simultaneous loggers
- Memory leak detection: 24-hour sustained logging
- File rotation efficiency: No blocking during rotation

#### Security Testing Strategy

**Validation Areas**:

- Sensitive data redaction accuracy (>99% detection rate)
- PII masking effectiveness with minimal false positives
- Log injection attack prevention
- File permission and access control verification

### Test Automation & CI Integration

#### Pre-commit Testing

- Unit test execution for modified components
