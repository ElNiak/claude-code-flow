- **Current**: 98.96% utilization (25.5GB/25.8GB) - System at capacity limit
- **Implementation**:
  - Circular buffers with adaptive sizing based on available memory
  - Zero-allocation patterns using object pooling for hot paths

  enableEmergencyMode(): void;
}
```

### 5. Test Strategy (TDD-First Implementation)

#### **Multi-Layer TDD Approach**

**Layer 1: Unit Testing (95% Coverage Target)**

- **Memory-Constrained Testing**: Validate <50MB footprint under 98%+ system utilization
- **Performance Testing**: <5%/<10% overhead measurement with automated regression detection
- **Component Testing**: Each of 9 subsystems with mock isolation and integration validation
- **Security Testing**: PII redaction, API key masking, sensitive data protection

**Layer 2: Integration Testing (90% Coverage Target)**  

- **Cross-Component Correlation**: End-to-end session tracking across CLI → Swarm → MCP
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Automated stderr-only validation with claude-code integration
- **High-Volume Load Testing**: 10,000+ entries/second sustained throughput validation
- **Memory Pressure Testing**: Debug logging stability at 95%+ memory utilization

**Layer 3: Performance Testing (100% Critical Path Coverage)**

- **Benchmark Integration**: Leverage existing `benchmark.test.ts` framework for regression testing
- **Memory Footprint Monitoring**: Continuous validation of <50MB constraint
- **Overhead Measurement**: Real-time performance impact monitoring with <5%/<10% gates
- **Emergency Mode Testing**: Circuit breaker behavior validation under extreme memory pressure

**Layer 4: End-to-End Validation (Production Simulation)**

- **Complete Workflow Testing**: Init → Debug Enable → Heavy Load → Analytics → Cleanup
- **External Integration**: ELK Stack, Splunk, DataDog compatibility validation
- **Production Safety**: Zero-disruption deployment with complete rollback capability
- **Monitoring Integration**: Real-time alerting and health check validation

#### **TDD Implementation Workflow**

1. **RED Phase**: Write failing tests for each debug logging feature
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass memory and performance constraints  
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Optimize for memory efficiency and zero-allocation patterns
4. **VALIDATE Phase**: Performance regression testing with automated gates

### 6. Tooling & Enforcement

#### **Pre-commit Hook Enhancement**

- repo: local
  hooks:
  - id: debug-logging-validation
    name: Debug Logging Pattern Validation
    entry: node scripts/validate-debug-patterns.js
    language: system
    files: '\.ts$'
  - id: memory-footprint-check  
    name: Memory Footprint Regression Check
    entry: npm run test:memory-footprint

    pass_filenames: false
  - id: console-call-detection
    name: Console Call Migration Validation
    entry: node scripts/detect-console-usage.js
    language: system
    files: '\.ts$'
```

#### **VS Code Integration Enhancement**

  "debug.logging.level": "trace",
  "debug.logging.components": ["swarm", "mcp", "memory"],
  "problems.decorations.enabled": true,
  "problems.showCurrentInStatus": true
}
```

#### **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**

- **Build Gates**: TypeScript compilation with debug logging types validation
- **Memory Gates**: Automated failure on >10% memory footprint increase
- **Performance Gates**: <5%/<10% overhead validation with automated rollback
- **Coverage Gates**: >95% test coverage requirement for debug infrastructure

### 7. Risks & Mitigations

#### **CRITICAL RISK: Memory Exhaustion (Probability: High, Impact: System Failure)**

**Risk**: Debug logging in 98.96% memory environment causes out-of-memory crashes
**Indicators**:

- System operating at maximum capacity with minimal headroom
- 4,230+ console calls create high logging volume potential  
- Real-time memory monitoring shows fluctuating pressure

**Mitigations**:

- **Emergency Circuit Breaker**: Auto-disable at 95% memory threshold with immediate logging suspension
- **Adaptive Buffer Management**: Dynamic buffer sizing (10K → 1K entries) based on available memory
- **Zero-Allocation Patterns**: Object pooling, pre-allocated buffers, circular buffer reuse
- **Background Processing**: Worker thread delegation for expensive logging operations

#### **HIGH RISK: Performance Regression (Probability: Medium, Impact: User Experience)**

**Risk**: Debug logging overhead exceeds <5%/<10% targets impacting user operations
**Indicators**:

- Current console logging creates significant throughput reduction
- High-frequency operations in CLI commands, agent spawning, MCP protocol calls
- Memory pressure creates additional CPU overhead for garbage collection

**Mitigations**:

- **Conditional Compilation**: Debug code paths eliminated in production builds when disabled
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Expensive debug operations only executed when logging level permits
- **Performance Budget Enforcement**: Automated CI/CD gates failing builds on regression
- **Intelligent Sampling**: Rate limiting for high-volume operations to prevent overhead

#### **MEDIUM RISK: Integration Complexity Failure (Probability: Medium, Impact: Implementation Delay)**

**Risk**: Complex integration across 9 subsystems causes systematic failures and delays
**Indicators**:

- 333+ files requiring analysis and potential modification
- Cross-component dependencies creating integration challenges
- Mixed JavaScript/TypeScript patterns complicating systematic replacement

**Mitigations**:

- **Incremental Integration**: Component-by-component rollout with validation gates
- **Automated Migration Tools**: Pattern-based console.* replacement with validation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: >95% test coverage with integration validation
- **Rollback Capability**: Complete component-level rollback at each phase gate

#### **LOW RISK: MCP Protocol Compliance Failure (Probability: Low, Impact: Claude-Code Integration)**

**Risk**: Debug logging interferes with MCP protocol communication or format requirements
**Indicators**:

- MCP protocol strict stderr-only requirement for debug output
- Complex claude-code integration requiring session correlation
- JSON-RPC format compliance for protocol messages

**Mitigations**:

- **Dedicated MCP Adapter**: Separate debug routing with protocol-aware formatting
- **Automated Compliance Testing**: Continuous validation of stderr-only output requirement
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end validation with claude-code session correlation
- **Protocol Isolation**: Debug logging completely separated from MCP communication
