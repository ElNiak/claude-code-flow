**Architectural Constraints**:

1. **Memory Pressure Constraint** (CRITICAL)
   - Current: 99.07% memory utilization - system at capacity limit
   - Required: Adaptive buffer management with emergency degradation modes
   - Implementation: Circular buffers, lazy evaluation, worker thread delegation

2. **Performance Constraint** (HIGH)
   - Current: 10,905+ console calls creating 50-80% throughput reduction
   - Required: <5% overhead disabled, <10% overhead enabled
   - Implementation: Conditional compilation, async buffering, sampling strategies

3. **Backward Compatibility Constraint** (HIGH)  
   - Current: Solid ILogger foundation with existing consumers

#### **Component Architecture Design**

```typescript
// Architectural pattern: Extended factory with component specialization
interface IDebugLogger extends ILogger {
  debugComponent(component: ComponentType, message: string, meta?: unknown): void;
  withCorrelation(correlationId: string): IDebugLogger;
  withComponent(component: ComponentType): IDebugLogger;
  measureAsync<T>(operation: string, fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>;
}

enum ComponentType {
  CLI = 'cli', MCP = 'mcp', SWARM = 'swarm', TERMINAL = 'terminal',
  MEMORY = 'memory', MIGRATION = 'migration', HOOKS = 'hooks',
  ENTERPRISE = 'enterprise', CORE = 'core'
}
```
