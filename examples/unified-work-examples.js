ðŸš€ Claude Flow Unified Work Command Examples
===========================================

The unified work command intelligently analyzes your task and coordinates
the optimal execution strategy automatically.

Basic Usage:
-----------

1. Simple Development Task:
   npx claude-flow work "build a REST API with authentication"

   â†’ Auto-detects: development task
   â†’ Spawns: 4 agents (architect, coder, tester, coordinator)
   â†’ Uses: hierarchical topology, parallel strategy
   â†’ Includes: code generation, testing, git operations

2. Research Task:
   npx claude-flow work "research machine learning frameworks for computer vision"

   â†’ Auto-detects: research task
   â†’ Spawns: 3 agents (researcher, analyst, coordinator)
   â†’ Uses: mesh topology, adaptive strategy
   â†’ Includes: web search, analysis, documentation

3. Deployment Task:
   npx claude-flow work "deploy application to production with monitoring"

   â†’ Auto-detects: deployment task
   â†’ Spawns: 3 agents (devops, monitor, coordinator)
   â†’ Uses: ring topology, sequential strategy
   â†’ Includes: system operations, monitoring, validation

Preset Usage:
------------

4. Using Research Preset:
   npx claude-flow work "analyze GraphQL vs REST APIs" --preset research

   â†’ Uses predefined research configuration
   â†’ Optimized for information gathering and analysis

5. Using Development Preset:
   npx claude-flow work "implement user authentication system" --preset development

   â†’ Uses predefined development configuration
   â†’ Optimized for code generation and testing

6. Using API Development Preset:
   npx claude-flow work "build GraphQL API with real-time subscriptions" --preset api

   â†’ Uses API-specific configuration
   â†’ Includes authentication, testing, documentation

Custom Configuration:
--------------------

7. Custom Agent Count:
   npx claude-flow work "build microservices architecture" --agents 8

   â†’ Uses 8 agents for complex distributed system
   â†’ Auto-selects appropriate agent types and coordination

8. Custom Topology:
   npx claude-flow work "implement CI/CD pipeline" --topology ring --strategy sequential

   â†’ Uses ring topology for pipeline flow
   â†’ Sequential strategy for safe deployment steps

9. Dry Run Mode:
   npx claude-flow work "complex full-stack application" --dry-run --verbose

   â†’ Shows execution plan without running
   â†’ Displays agent allocation and coordination strategy

Advanced Examples:
-----------------

10. Configuration File:
    # Create claude-flow.config.json:
    {
      "coordination": {
        "defaultAgents": 6,
        "defaultTopology": "hierarchical"
      },
      "presets": {
        "enterprise": {
          "agents": 10,
          "topology": "hierarchical",
          "features": ["security", "scalability", "monitoring"]
        }
      }
    }

    npx claude-flow work "build enterprise application" --preset enterprise

11. Environment Variables:
    export CLAUDE_FLOW_AGENTS=5
    export CLAUDE_FLOW_TOPOLOGY=mesh
    export CLAUDE_FLOW_STRATEGY=adaptive

    npx claude-flow work "optimize database performance"

12. JSON Output:
    npx claude-flow work "analyze system architecture" --output json --dry-run

    â†’ Outputs execution plan in JSON format
    â†’ Useful for automation and tooling integration

14. Enterprise Integration:
    npx claude-flow work "integrate legacy system with modern microservices architecture including API gateway, service mesh, and event-driven communication" --preset enterprise

15. Data Pipeline:
    npx claude-flow work "create data pipeline with ETL processes, real-time streaming, machine learning inference, and visualization dashboard" --agents 8 --strategy adaptive

Intelligence Features:
---------------------

The unified work command provides:

âœ… Automatic Task Type Detection
   â†’ Analyzes keywords and context to determine task type

âœ… Complexity Assessment
   â†’ Evaluates task complexity using weighted scoring

âœ… Context Analysis
   â†’ Examines project structure, dependencies, and environment

Getting Started:
---------------

1. Try a simple task:
   npx claude-flow work "create a simple web server"

2. Use dry run to see the plan:
   npx claude-flow work "your task here" --dry-run --verbose

3. Experiment with presets:
   npx claude-flow work "your task" --preset development

4. Customize as needed:
   npx claude-flow work "your task" --agents 5 --topology mesh

The unified work command makes AI-assisted development simple, intelligent,
and powerful. It replaces dozens of commands with one smart interface that
adapts to your needs automatically.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
