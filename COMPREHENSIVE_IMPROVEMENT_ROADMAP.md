## Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization (Immediate - 1-2 months)

### Critical Fixes (P0) - Week 1-4

#### 1. Memory Management Crisis Resolution üö®
**Issue**: Systematic memory leaks across 23+ identified critical points causing system instability
- **Timer Leak Epidemic**: Untracked timers in async operations, coordination layers, and agent lifecycle
- **Event Listener Leaks**: Missing cleanup in connection handlers, process monitors, and state watchers
- **Promise Leaks**: Unresolved promises in timeout handling and coordination protocols
- **SQLite WAL Issues**: Active WAL files indicating potential database corruption

**Implementation Plan**:
```typescript
// Week 1: Resource Tracking System
class ResourceTracker {
  private timers = new Set<NodeJS.Timeout>();
  private listeners = new Map<string, Function[]>();
  private promises = new Set<Promise<any>>();

  trackTimer(timer: NodeJS.Timeout): NodeJS.Timeout {
    this.timers.add(timer);
    return timer;
  }

  cleanup(): void {
    this.timers.forEach(timer => clearTimeout(timer));
    this.listeners.forEach((listeners, event) =>
      listeners.forEach(listener => process.removeListener(event, listener))
    );
    // Implement promise cancellation patterns
  }
}

// Week 2-3: Integration across all components
// Week 4: Automated memory leak detection in CI/CD
```

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] Zero resource leaks under 24-hour stress testing
- [ ] <40MB memory usage for typical workloads
- [ ] 95%+ system uptime under production load
- [ ] Automated CI/CD memory leak validation

#### 2. Security Hardening üîí
**Issue**: Command injection vulnerabilities and inadequate input sanitization
- **Shell Command Construction**: Unsafe process spawning in hook execution
- **Input Validation**: Missing sanitization for user-provided commands
- **Process Isolation**: Inadequate security boundaries between agents

**Implementation Plan**:
```typescript
// Week 1: Input Sanitization Framework
class SecurityValidator {
  static validateCommand(cmd: string): ValidationResult {
    // Implement whitelist-based command validation
    // Add shell injection prevention
    // Validate file paths and arguments
  }

  static sanitizeInput(input: string): string {
    // Remove dangerous characters
    // Escape special shell characters
    // Validate against known safe patterns
  }
}

// Week 2: Process Isolation
class SecureProcessManager {
  spawn(command: string, options: SpawnOptions): ChildProcess {
    // Validate command through SecurityValidator
    // Apply resource limits and sandboxing
    // Implement proper cleanup and monitoring
  }
}
```

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] Zero critical/high security vulnerabilities
- [ ] 100% input validation coverage
- [ ] Security audit passing grade
- [ ] Automated security scanning in CI/CD

#### 3. TypeScript Compilation Crisis üõ†Ô∏è
**Issue**: 735 TypeScript errors preventing production deployment

- **Interface Mismatches**: 80+ argument type mismatches in agent communication
- **Missing Definitions**: 50+ object literal property errors

**Implementation Plan** (6-8 hours focused effort):
```typescript
// Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (2-4 hours)
interface CLIFlags {
  agents?: number;
  strategy?: string;
  topology?: string;
  // Define all flag properties properly
}

// Phase 2: Agent Communication (1-2 hours)
interface AgentId {
  id: string;
  type: AgentType;
  capabilities: string[];
}

// Phase 3: Configuration Interfaces (1 hour)
interface MemoryConfig extends BaseConfig {
  persistent: boolean;
  databases: string[];
  namespace: string;
}
```

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] CLI fully functional in TypeScript mode
- [ ] REPL system operational
- [ ] Agent coordination working properly

#### 4. Hook Implementation Gap Resolution üîó
**Issue**: 70% of hooks are placeholder-only implementations (console.log statements)
- **PostToolUse Hooks**: Critical result processing missing
- **Session Management**: No actual state persistence
- **Coordination Hooks**: Inter-agent communication non-functional

**Implementation Plan**:
```typescript
// Week 1: Core Safety Hooks
class UserPromptSubmitHook {
  async execute(prompt: string): Promise<ValidatedPrompt> {
    // Implement actual user input validation
    // Add security filtering and sanitization
    // Store interaction history for learning
  }
}

// Week 2: PostToolUse Implementation
class PostEditHook {
  async execute(result: EditResult): Promise<ProcessedResult> {
    // Format code according to project standards
    // Validate changes and run basic checks
    // Store metrics and learning data
    // Trigger downstream notifications
  }
}

// Week 3: Session Management
class SessionRestoreHook {
  async execute(sessionId: string): Promise<SessionState> {
    // Restore actual session state from persistence
    // Reconstruct agent coordination context
    // Load memory and decision history
  }
}
```

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] 0% placeholder-only hook implementations (currently 70%)
- [ ] 100% core safety hooks implemented
- [ ] Basic coordination functionality working
- [ ] Session persistence operational
