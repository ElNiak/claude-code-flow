# Hooks Implementation Analysis - Complete

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Components

The hooks system in Claude Flow is built around a sophisticated 4-layer architecture:

1. **Hook Wrapper Layer** (`src/hooks/hook-wrapper.ts`)
   - Provides simplified API for hook execution
   - Singleton pattern with `HookWrapper.getInstance()`
   - Comprehensive debug logging integration
   - Environment-based enable/disable controls
   - **8 core hook types** with dedicated methods:
     - `preTask()`, `postTask()` - Task lifecycle hooks
     - `preEdit()`, `postEdit()` - File operation hooks
     - `preBash()` - Command safety validation
     - `preRead()` - File access preparation
     - `notify()` - Custom notifications
     - `sessionRestore()`, `sessionEnd()` - Session management

2. **Hook Execution Manager** (`src/hooks/hook-execution-manager.ts`)
   - Queue-based serialization to prevent deadlocks
   - Process pool management (3-process default)
   - **Priority-based execution** (high/medium/low)
   - **Comprehensive timeout enforcement**:
     - pre-task: 5s, post-edit: 3s, post-task: 10s
     - pre-bash: 2s, pre-edit: 2s, pre-read: 1s
     - notify: 1s, session-restore: 15s, session-end: 20s
   - **Direct execution mode** (no process spawning)
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Performance metrics tracking

3. **Hook Coordinator** (`src/hooks/hook-coordinator.ts`)
   - **Deadlock prevention system** with circular dependency detection
   - **Memory-based coordination locks** (30s timeout)
   - **Dependency graph management** with 9 hook types
   - **Resource contention analysis** (max 3 concurrent hooks)
   - Emergency reset and graceful shutdown capabilities
   - Cross-process coordination without file system overhead

4. **CLI Implementation** (`src/cli/simple-commands/hooks.ts`)
   - **2300+ lines** of comprehensive hook handlers
   - **15+ hook command types** with full validation
   - JSON stdin parsing for Claude Code integration
   - Memory store integration (SQLite-based)
   - Built-in plugin system with external plugin support
