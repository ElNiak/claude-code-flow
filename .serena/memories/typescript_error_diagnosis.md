# TypeScript Import Error Diagnosis

## Error Found: Duplicate Export Declaration

**File**: `/src/unified/work/index.ts`

**Problem**: The TypeScript error "Unexpected reserved word" is caused by duplicate export of `WorkOptions` type:

1. **Line 17**: `WorkOptions` exported via re-export from `./types.js`
2. **Line 333**: `WorkOptions` redeclared as `export type WorkOptions = any;`

## Root Cause
TypeScript doesn't allow the same identifier to be exported twice from the same module. The duplicate export causes a syntax error that manifests as "Unexpected reserved word".

## Files Affected
- `src/unified/work/index.ts` (primary issue)
- `src/unified/work/types.ts` (contains original WorkOptions definition)

## Solution Required
Remove the duplicate export on line 333 since WorkOptions is already properly exported from types.js on line 17.
