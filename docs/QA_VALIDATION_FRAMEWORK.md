# QA Validation Framework for Claude Flow v2.0.0

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive quality validation framework that ensures testing implementation meets high standards and provides reliable results for the Claude Flow project.

## 1. Quality Standards and Metrics

### 1.1 Test Quality Standards

#### Code Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 85% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Minimum 70% coverage for critical paths
- **E2E Tests**: 100% coverage for primary user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Coverage for all performance-critical components

#### Test Reliability Standards
- **Flakiness Rate**: Maximum 2% test failure rate due to flaky tests
- **Execution Time**: Tests must complete within defined timeout limits
- **Resource Usage**: Memory usage during tests should not exceed 2GB
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests must be safe for parallel execution

#### Code Quality Metrics
```javascript
{
  "codeQuality": {
    "cyclomaticComplexity": { "max": 10, "average": 5 },
    "maintainabilityIndex": { "min": 70 },
