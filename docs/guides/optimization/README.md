## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start Guide

### For Development Teams

#### 1. **Immediate Actions (Week 1)**
```bash
# Start with critical blockers
1. Read 00_MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Review 01_PLACEHOLDER_ELIMINATION_PLAN.md Phase 1
3. Begin with build-breaking TODOs
4. Implement OAuth authentication
```

#### 2. **Foundation Phase (Weeks 1-4)**
```bash
# Execute in parallel:
- Placeholder elimination (critical TODOs)
- Code duplication removal (help system, agent management)
- Simplification enhancement (error handling, auth)
- Architecture standardization (file extensions, patterns)
```

#### 3. **Quality Phase (Weeks 5-8)**
```bash
# Focus on quality improvements:
- Test coverage implementation
- Performance optimization
- Security enhancements
- Monitoring systems
```
