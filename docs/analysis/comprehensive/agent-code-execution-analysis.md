# üîç **Code Execution Related to Each Agent Type**

## üìä **CRITICAL FINDING: Agents Are COORDINATION TEMPLATES, Not Code Executors**

After analyzing the codebase, here's what code is actually related to each agent type:

## üé≠ **THE TRUTH: Agents Generate Specialized Claude Code Prompts**

### **Location**: `hive-mind.js:2113-2250` - `generateHiveMindPrompt()` & `getWorkerTypeInstructions()`

**Each agent type creates specialized instructions for Claude Code instances:**

### **üîç RESEARCHER Agent**
```javascript
researcher: `- Conduct thorough research using WebSearch and WebFetch
- Document findings in structured formats
- Validate source credibility and relevance
- Synthesize insights from multiple sources

```

**Generated Claude Code Context:**
```

## üîß **ACTUAL CODE EXECUTION MECHANISM**

### **1. Agent Spawning Process**
**Location**: `hive-mind.js:2003-2110` - `spawnClaudeCodeInstances()`

```javascript
// For each agent type, generate a specialized Claude Code command
const commands = [];

workerTypes.forEach(type => {
  const typeWorkers = workerGroups[type];
  const instructions = getWorkerTypeInstructions(type);

  const command = createClaudeCodeSpawnCommand(
    swarmId, swarmName, objective, type, typeWorkers, instructions
  );

  commands.push(command);
});
```

### **2. Command Generation**
**Location**: `hive-mind.js:2025-2050` - `createClaudeCodeSpawnCommand()`

```javascript
function createClaudeCodeSpawnCommand(swarmId, swarmName, objective, workerType, typeWorkers, instructions) {
  const context = `You are a ${workerType} agent in the "${swarmName}" Hive Mind swarm.
üéØ MISSION: ${objective}
üêù SWARM COORDINATION:
- Swarm ID: ${swarmId}
- Your Role: ${workerType.toUpperCase()} specialist
- Team Size: ${typeWorkers.length} ${workerType}(s)

üß† MANDATORY COORDINATION PROTOCOL:
1. BEFORE starting work: [MCP coordination calls]
2. DURING work: [Memory and progress updates]
3. FOR decisions: [Consensus mechanisms]

${getWorkerTypeInstructions(workerType)}`;

  const command = `claude code --context "${context.replace(/"/g, '\\"')}"`;

  return {
    title: `${workerType.toUpperCase()} Agent`,
    command,
    context,
    workerType,
    count: typeWorkers.length
  };
}
```

### **3. Execution Flow**
```
1. User runs: claude-flow hive-mind spawn "Build API" --claude
2. System analyzes objective ‚Üí selects optimal agent types
3. For each agent type ‚Üí generates specialized Claude Code prompt
4. System spawns separate Claude Code instances with agent-specific instructions
5. Each Claude Code instance executes with its specialized role context
```

```

**This instance executes:**

## ‚úÖ **CONCLUSION: Agents Are Specialized Claude Code Executors**

1. **Agent types don't execute different code engines** - they all run Claude Code
2. **Agent types provide specialized context/instructions** to Claude Code instances
3. **Each agent type gets different behavioral prompts** that influence tool usage
4. **Coordination happens via MCP tools** for memory sharing and consensus
5. **Real work is done by Claude Code** with agent-specific expertise context

**The genius is**: Instead of building separate execution engines for each agent type, the system leverages Claude Code's native capabilities with specialized prompting to create behaviorally distinct agents that coordinate through shared memory and consensus mechanisms.
