# Serena MCP Timeout Validation Test Plan

## Objective
Test the current 20-second timeout setting in .serena/project.yml and validate:
1. Does tool_timeout actually work?
2. What happens when tools exceed timeout?
3. Token consumption differences at different timeout levels
4. Recommended timeout for minimal token usage

## Test Strategy

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis (tool_timeout: 20)
- Test various mcp__serena tools with normal operations
- Measure execution time and token usage
- Document baseline behavior

### Phase 2: Timeout Configuration Testing
- Test with different timeout values: 10, 15, 30 seconds
- Compare behavior and performance
- Identify optimal timeout

### Phase 3: Edge Case Testing
- Test operations that might exceed timeout
- Document failure modes
- Measure recovery behavior

## Test Cases

### TC1: Normal Operations (Baseline)
- list_dir on various directories
- find_file with different patterns
- search_for_pattern on large codebases
- get_symbols_overview on complex files

### TC2: Potentially Long Operations
- search_for_pattern with complex regex on entire codebase
- get_symbols_overview on large directories
- find_symbol with broad searches

### TC3: Timeout Boundary Testing
- Operations designed to take exactly around timeout limit
- Document what happens at timeout

## Execution Timeline
1. Start: Current config (20s timeout)
2. Test Phase 1: Baseline measurements
3. Test Phase 2: Different timeout values
4. Test Phase 3: Edge cases
5. Report: Final recommendations

## Metrics to Track
- Execution time per tool
- Token consumption
- Success/failure rates
- Error messages on timeout
- Tool responsiveness

## Test Started: [TIMESTAMP]
