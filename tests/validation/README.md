## 🎯 Quality Gates

### Automated Quality Gates
```typescript
const qualityGates = {
  integrationScore: { minimum: 95, blocking: true },
  promptQualityScore: { minimum: 90, blocking: true },
  performanceScore: { minimum: 85, blocking: true },
  overallScore: { minimum: 90, blocking: true },
  testCoverage: { minimum: 90, blocking: true },
  errorCount: { maximum: 5, blocking: false }
};
```

### Gate Evaluation
- **PASS**: All blocking gates meet minimum thresholds
- **WARNING**: Non-blocking gates fail but blocking gates pass
- **FAIL**: Any blocking gate fails to meet minimum threshold

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Test Timeouts**
```bash
# Increase timeout for complex tests
npm test -- --testTimeout=120000
```

**2. Memory Issues**
```bash
# Run with increased memory
node --max-old-space-size=4096 node_modules/.bin/jest
```

**3. Coverage Issues**
```bash
# Generate detailed coverage report
npm run test:coverage:detailed
```

**4. Performance Failures**
```bash
# Run performance tests in isolation
npm test tests/validation/performance-validation.test.ts
```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Verbose test output
npm test -- --verbose --no-cache

# Run specific test file with debugging
DEBUG=* npm test tests/validation/unified-work-integration.test.ts

# Profile memory usage
node --inspect node_modules/.bin/jest tests/validation/
```

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
1. **Identify test category** (integration, prompt engineering, performance)
2. **Create test case** following existing patterns
3. **Update test runner** if needed
4. **Verify quality gates** are met
5. **Update documentation**

### Test Quality Standards
- ✅ Tests are independent and isolated
- ✅ Clear descriptions and assertions
- ✅ Appropriate mocks and fixtures
- ✅ Performance considerations addressed
- ✅ Edge cases and error scenarios covered
- ✅ Security implications validated

### Performance Considerations
- Keep unit tests under 1 second each
- Use mocking for external dependencies
- Implement proper cleanup in afterEach
- Monitor memory usage in long-running tests
- Use parallel execution where possible
